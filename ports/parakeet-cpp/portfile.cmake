# parakeet-cpp: NVIDIA Parakeet ASR + Sortformer diarization in pure C++/ggml.
# Sourced from the engines/parakeet/ subfolder of tetherto/qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp;
# consumes the ggml-speech port.
#
# Long-audio memory fix: bound offline-transcription memory. transcribe_samples
# / transcribe_samples_stream previously ran the conformer encoder over the whole
# input in a single graph (O(T_enc^2) self-attention), OOMing on multi-hour files
# (~100 GB for a 90 min file, SIGKILL). This pin computes the mel once (global
# CMVN) and slides the encoder over it in overlapping windows, trimming the
# shared context at the interior seams; inputs that fit one window keep the
# bit-identical single-pass path. Requires ggml-speech >= 2026-07-15 (unchanged
# from the previous pin).
#
# Apple Core ML (Neural Engine) encoder sidecar: adds the optional, Apple-only
# `coreml` feature (default on osx/ios). When enabled and a matching
# `<model>-encoder.mlmodelc` is present at runtime, the FastConformer encoder
# runs on the Apple Neural Engine while mel preprocessing, TDT/CTC decode and the
# tokenizer stay on ggml; a missing sidecar or a non-Apple build falls back to
# the ggml encoder. Additive and presence-driven -- non-Apple platforms are
# unaffected.
#
# qvac-parakeet namespace: the engine's installable artifacts moved out of the
# bare `parakeet` name so this port and `whisper-cpp` can share one vcpkg
# prefix. Upstream whisper.cpp v1.9.1+ builds and installs its own parakeet
# (lib/libparakeet.*, lib/cmake/parakeet/, parakeet.pc, include/parakeet.h)
# from its monolithic src/parakeet.cpp, and vcpkg refuses two owners of one
# file -- installing both ports previously failed on lib/parakeet.lib. Ours is
# now libqvac-parakeet.*, the CMake package is `qvac-parakeet` (imported target
# `qvac::parakeet`, was `parakeet-cpp` / `parakeet::parakeet`) and there is a
# new qvac-parakeet.pc. Consumers must switch to
# find_package(qvac-parakeet CONFIG) + qvac::parakeet -- see the
# transcription-parakeet update that lands alongside this bump. The C++
# `parakeet::` namespace, the include/parakeet/ header directory and this
# port's own name are unchanged; only file ownership moved.
#
# Pinned at tetherto/qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp master HEAD 928369c9, shared with
# the whisper-cpp / tts-cpp / audiogen-cpp ports so all four resolve one source
# archive. engines/parakeet is byte-identical to the previous 35cc600e pin
# (PR #106, the namespace rename described above); 928369c9 is its child and
# touches engines/audiogen only. 35cc600e itself layered the rename on the
# Core ML encoder sidecar (22423551, PR #100) and the long-audio windowed
# encoder (88b690c0, PR #101).

# The engine installs its package config to lib/cmake/qvac-parakeet (was
# share/parakeet-cpp) under the new namespace; the imported target is
# qvac::parakeet.
vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(PACKAGE_NAME qvac-parakeet CONFIG_PATH lib/cmake/qvac-parakeet)

# New in this pin: the engine also installs lib/pkgconfig/qvac-parakeet.pc,
# whose prefix= is the absolute CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR at configure time. Rewrite
# it to the relocatable ${pcfiledir}-relative form, as the whisper-cpp and
# ggml-speech ports already do -- without this the port trips vcpkg's
# absolute-paths post-build check, and any cached binary would carry a path
# that does not exist on the consuming machine.
#
# The .pc also carries ggml's own -L/-I, which the engine derives from the
# resolved location of the imported ggml target so the file is self-sufficient
# for non-vcpkg consumers. Under vcpkg those land inside CURRENT_INSTALLED_DIR
# (ggml-speech installs into the same prefix), so they must become
# ${prefix}-relative or the packaged .pc carries this machine's paths and
# breaks every consumer that restores it from the binary cache -- the .pc
# content is part of the cached package and the ABI hash does not include the
# install root.
#
# vcpkg_fixup_pkgconfig() rewrites CURRENT_INSTALLED_DIR to ${prefix}, but only
# by exact string match, and the two sides can disagree on spelling: CMake
# emits the path as it resolved it (macOS writes /tmp/... where vcpkg passes
# /private/tmp/...), so the rewrite silently misses. Normalise by *meaning*
# rather than by spelling: rewrite any absolute -L/-I whose realpath lands
# inside the install prefix to the ${prefix}-relative form.
# Scope of the shipped .pc, verified on this port build: it is complete for
# CMake consumption (find_package(qvac-parakeet) + qvac::parakeet, which is what
# the qvac addon uses) and for pkg-config against a SHARED ggml, where
# libqvac-speech-ggml.so pulls its backend siblings transitively. It is NOT
# sufficient for pkg-config against this port's STATIC ggml with backends
# compiled in: the engine derives only ggml + ggml-base, so a static
# pkg-config link fails on the backend registration symbols
# (ggml_backend_{cpu,blas,metal}_reg, which live in the per-backend archives)
# plus their frameworks. Fixing that means deriving GGML_AVAILABLE_BACKENDS and
# their interface frameworks in the engine's .pc generation -- tracked as an
# engine follow-up, not worked around here, because duplicating that logic in
# the portfile would drift from the engine.
