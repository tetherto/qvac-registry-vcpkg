# speech-cpp: umbrella port over tetherto/qvac-ext-lib-whisper.cpp (QIP #94,
# Ticket 4). One source pin, per-engine features:
#
#   speech-cpp[whisper]                  -> third_party/whisper.cpp (package `whisper`)
#   speech-cpp[parakeet]                 -> engines/parakeet        (package `qvac-parakeet`)
#   speech-cpp[chatterbox|supertonic]    -> engines/tts             (package `tts-cpp`)
#
# The repo-root CMakeLists.txt is the superbuild this port drives: it resolves
# ONE system ggml (find_package(ggml) from the ggml-speech port) and hands it
# to every enabled engine, so the whole stack shares a single ggml pin — the
# ggml/ tree vendored inside the whisper subtree is never compiled. Backend
# selection (metal / vulkan / opencl / cuda) is therefore expressed purely as
# ggml-speech features in vcpkg.json; the GGML_* flags passed below only steer
# engine-side gating (e.g. which GPU paths the engines consider validated).
#
# Upstream whisper.cpp v1.9.1+ ships its own C-API `parakeet` (lib/libparakeet.*,
# lib/cmake/parakeet/, parakeet.pc) which collides with engines/parakeet. The
# umbrella forces WHISPER_BUILD_PARAKEET=OFF, so with [whisper,parakeet] enabled
# only OUR parakeet is built and installed — under the qvac-parakeet namespace
# (find_package(qvac-parakeet) + qvac::parakeet) — and upstream's is neither
# built nor installed. No file-ownership clash, no wasted build.
#
# Pinned at master HEAD d09cdb9e, the same commit (and the same source archive)
# as the standalone tts-cpp port; whisper-cpp / parakeet-cpp pin 928369c9,
# whose third_party/whisper.cpp and engines/parakeet subtrees are byte-identical
# to d09cdb9e (everything in between touches engines/tts, engines/audiogen and
# .github only). The standalone ports remain available transitionally; this
# port supersedes them.
